This is my vision.
My vision of this future.
The future of Gameboy, Oh Boy!

My vision, not of Gameboy Ohboy, but of a better emulator.
Of course, it will be the same, but with a better name and not just gameboy stuff, thats too bad.
I am talking about my new name...

Omega Emulator.
You know of Delta, its the primary iOS thing after all.
I will surpass them.

Why, you may ask?
Not out of anger, but out of...
Respect.

I will finish this project.
I will finish this project.
There is no possible way I wont.
